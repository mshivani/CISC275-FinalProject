So I’m trying to register for classes for my finance major, but I have no idea which ones to take. Any ideas?
Check your degree audit

Email a random professor and ask

Hey roomie! You’re in ENGL110 right? I am too! I heard there’s a writing center on campus that will look at your papers for you. You have to set-up a meeting though

Hey roomie! Not to be a hypochondriac, but do you know if we can get a flu shot somewhere at campus?
Yes, at Student Health
Go to your family Doctor
I'll give you the shot myself
I know a guy
