Hey! It's me, your roommate. I just declared my major, and I'm about to register for classes! Hope it's cool, but I might text you with some questions.

Hey roomie! I have a class in my schedule that I do not want to take and I want to replace it with another class. Do you know when the drop/add deadline is?
2 weeks after the first day of class.
3 weeks after the first day of class.
4 weeks after the first day of class.
Trick question-There is no deadline!
The last day of the semester.
So I'm trying to register for classes, but I have no idea which ones to take. Any ideas?
Check your degree audit.
Just guess.
Email a random professor and ask.
Ask your parents.
Take anything. It doesn't matter.
Hey roomie! You're in ENGL110 right? I am too! I heard there's a writing center on campus that will look at your papers for you. You have to set-up a meeting though

Hey someone told me I can find the important dates on the calendar on the registrar’s website, in the UD Student Guide, and at the college academic advisement office. That’s a lot of places.

Hey roomie! Not to be a hypochondriac, but do you know if we can get a flu shot somewhere at campus?
Yes, at Student Health
Go to your family doctor
I'll give you the shot myself.
I know a guy.
What does hypochondriac mean?
