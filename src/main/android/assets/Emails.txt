Add your Major
Hi New Blue Hen,
Welcome to the University of Delaware! I’m your faculty advisor, Dr. Doc. I’m here to help you out with all your academic and career goals! Don’t worry. You don’t need to pick your career just yet, but you do need to pick a major. Head over to UDSIS and declare your major. Once I see in UDSIS that you’ve declared your major, I’ll shoot you another email with some more information.
Best,
Dr. Doctor

Hi New Blue Hen,
I saw that you declared your major. Congratulations! It’s time to register for classes. You can do that on UDSIS too. Head over there now and pick out five classes.

Degree Audit
Hi New Blue Hen,
I’m glad to see you picked your classes! If you need help deciding on what to take, you can always shoot me an email to with a question or to set-up a meeting. Otherwise, you can check out your degree audit on UDSIS. It’ll tell you what classes you’ve taken and what classes are left to be completed for your degree. You can also look at the course catalog to see what your major requirements are.
Thanks,
Your Advisor
