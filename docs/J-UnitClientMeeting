J-Unit Client Meeting

Objectives: To better understand
  1) the client’s vision for the product
  2) the opportunity/benefits of the product that the client envisions
  3) a list of potential features of the product
  4) any other requirements for the product such as usability, reliability, security, performance, etc.

Questions to ask:
  1) We are envisioning the project to follow a story that is guided by the computer. Do you want this to be the driving force of the game? Would you rather have a game that is user driven?
  2) How do you want to ensure comprehension of the material? (i.e. displaying correct answer after every question, taking a test at the end, etc.)
  3) Based on other projects like this you have seen before, what features have you liked and disliked from those projects?
  4) Would you like instructions/help/hints to be offered to the user?
